# InkscapeCircuitsTemplate
An Inkscape template for quickly creating circuit diagrams, block diagrams etc.
The base template was created by Prof. L. Umanand of IISc Bangalore sometime in the late 2000s and has seen many minor changes and improvements over the years.

Most of these changes were made by members of the Power Group (PEG-DESE) but have not been tracked / documented.

There are some minor issues with this file at present but none of these should affect usability.
